is proved. he shall be condemned (to pay the fine) to the people. and shall

see that judgment is pronounced on him.' The obiect of having recourse ,

to the board of recuperatores is to insure the prompt collection of the fine.
-pariat = pateat, an unusual corruption. Patet is in this formula equiva-
lent to apparea— condumum: but just below condemnatus .· condumno
is not elsewhere sonna—quanti: genitive of valna—praedes: pmes,
praed-is is for pmeves‚ prae-vid-is (CI. 200, l. 46), compounded of prae and
vas, vad-is.--Se1 quis magistratus, etc.: ⁸ lf any magistrate choose to
propose a greater fine than the above, whoever shall thus choose may do
sc, provided it amount to less than half the man’s property, and to him
(i.e., this magistrate) the law shall apply in every respect just as if he had
exacted, in accordance with this law, only the amount prescribed above.'
A magistrate was said multam inrogare when he imposed a fine greater
than that prescribed by law: in that case the offender had the right of
appeal, and the matter was brought before the comitia tributa.— dum . .
taxeat (later written as one word): ‘provided it reaches' or ⁸ touches';
taxare, for *tactam is a frequentative from tangere (root tag-). Its con·
struction with the genitive is surprising. and reminds one os the genitive
aiter verbs of touching in Greek. We should expect the accusative.—
pat-tus: Introd. 37: ep. Castor-us, l. 17. Pars is here treated quite as
a consonant-stem (part-). though it was originally an i-stem (parti·).—
familias: gen. sing—omnium remm: ⁰ in all respects: For this old
use of the genitive Wordsworth aptly compares the formula eius leae lege
nihil rogatur, ‘regarding that nothing is proposed by this law· (CI. 200,
l. 34). — siremps (in prol. Plaut. Amph.73, sirempse) : ⁸ just so! The etymol-
ogy is probably si rem eampse, ‘thus in very fact ’ς si being ,τί-ι· without its
c, and rem eampse accusative os specification. For eampse see Plaut. Cist.
172. (Corssen's explanation is slightly different.) -quasei sei: pleonastic
for simple quasei,'as in n. 106. 1. l.4o, 11. l. 4, and generally in legal phrase·
ology: cp. prol. Plaut. Cas. 46. Analogous to nisi si, which is quite com·
mon. The spellings quasei and nisei are regular in inscriptions of this time,
though the poets, even Plautus and Ennius, measure always quasi, nm.
