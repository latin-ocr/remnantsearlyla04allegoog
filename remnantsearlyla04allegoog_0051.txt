etc.: ‘he has tulfilled the choice os his heare—auo and tua are mono-
⁴syllables.—-nocenda, etc. The general sense is: ⁰ begging thee under
favor to enable him fully to collect and fairly to divide the spoil: so that the
god may have his just due. facilia is explained as facultatem, but is cer·
tainly corrupt. ln cogendo} and dissolvendei we have the earliest in·
stances of -ei in genitive singular: see on n. 82, l. 7, Latina—A decuma
verae rationis is a tithe fairly computed: mtio in its book-keeping sense.

100. CI. 551. Found at Forum Popili (modern Polla) in northern Lu·
cania. The name os the magistrate at the beginning is lacking, but there
is no doubt that it was as above. P. Popilius Laenas was consul 622l132. Ι
The road described, from Regium to Capua, was a continuation of the Via
Appia, and may well have borne the name Via Popilia. The inscription
contains several spurious ei's3 secei, poseivei, conquaesivei, ndidei. ponteis
omneis (but aedis in last line). meilia, fhgitee'vos, probably eldem (τε i'dem).
On the other hand the spelling heic is justified—Regio: Regium, not
Rhegium, is the genuine Latin form of this name—miliarium sc. laffides:
elsewhere always wiltuna, neuter.— tabelarlos: what ? Hardly letter·
arrius, as usual. Perhaps tabellarios lapides, such for instance as the stone
bearing this very hiscription, which is certainly more than an ordinary mile-
stone.— poseiv01=poszv1 (Plautus), later posui. Ρόηο (for plo-sino) is a
compound of sino with the obsolete preposition por· (pos-‚ po-) . and so posim·
is its regular perfect.— For the following towns see map. Nuceria and Capua
are in one direction‚ Muranum and the rest -in the other. To Capua the
distance is 84 miles—„tt the older sign sor 50: L is seldom found before
Augustus's time.— cosentia = Consentia: Valentia == Vibo Valentia.
formerly Hipponium ,· ad fretum ad statuam3 the place called Columna
Regina, at the narrowest part os the strait‚ the usual place os crossing to

'Sicily.—Suma= summa, · the whole distance! — af: this old preposition,

noticed by Cicer0, Orat. xlvii.. occurs about seven times in inscriptions be-
fore c, v, Ι, m s. Corssen thinks it an entirely distinct preposition from ab.
