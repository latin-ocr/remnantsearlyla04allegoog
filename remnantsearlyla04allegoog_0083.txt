times. Just who the semones are it is hard to say. Most, connecting the
word with se-r-o, ,ri-men, think them gods of husbandry, standing in a
special relation to the Arvals. Mommsen takes them as ⁸ divinities’ in
general, explaining the name as se homines (old form hombnes), ⁶ apart
from men.·—advocapit = advocabit& .· future in imperative sense. Or
perhaps rather advocabite, an imperative formation corresponding to the
tenses in ·bam and -bo, The p for b is unexampled and probably due to a
mere blunder. In this line the brothers seem to address each other.—
conctos= cinctos. Both contracted from *calamon—V. 6. Triumpe:

150. CI. 195¹: On a stone of Parian marble found in the forum in 1566,
now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitol. C. Duilius defeated
the Carthaginians in the famous sea-light off Mylae, 494s260, and the
columna rostrata in the forum was set up iti commemoration of the event.
The present inscription, which seems to be the one mentioned by Quin· '
tilian (i. 7, 12) as containing final ds, is beyond all doubt os a later date,
cut in the time of the emperors. The only possible question is whether
it be a copy, more or less modernized, of an older one, or was composed
outright, in imitation of the old-fashioned language, by some antiquarian
under Claudius. The latter is the view of Mommsen and Ritschl, and to
it 1 heartily accede. What influences me is not so much the hyper-arch&
isms (macistmtc’s, exsociont), nor the paini'ul persistence of the ablative -d
in forms where it is otherwise unknown, as rather the length of the docu-
ment, its circumstantial, almost statistical, style, and its prose form. What
sort of an inscription Duilius set up, if any, may be gathered from the
Scipio-epitaphs and stom the triumphal inscriptions in Saturnian form long
after this time (see n. 217 flg.): it would bave been brief, simple, and in
Saturniam. We have then in this monument merely the work of a learned
trifler: is the column had originally any inscription at all, it was one very
different from this. -Line 1. Secestanos: read Segestanos. C appears
throughout for g (leciones, mac-istrata, exsociont, pucnandod, caet, Carta-
cim'ensis), although the sign G was in use in Duilius's time.—exemet:
so cepet, ornavet, l. 5, 7, Introd. 57 (2). He raised the siege of Segesta.
-L. 2. maximos manistratoe is of course nominative, as primos,
l. 7. The whole Carth. army and their ⁸ chief commander ’ retreat in broad
daylight. Both macastratos and extociont (π ecficge'nnt) are impossible
