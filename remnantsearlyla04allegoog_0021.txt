Chic! Phanetio Peculiarities of Early Latin.

6. Diphthong ai sor later ae .· quaistor.
7. Diphthong oi for later oe .· foidus.
a Diphthong oi (oe) for later ἧι oinos = ae‘inus. ·

9. Diphthong ei preserved. This diphthong had an im·
portant place in the earliest Latin sound-system, but we find
it subject to decay even in our oldest monuments of written
Latin, passing sometimes into ἓ, sometimes into i ; finally,
in the ‘ classical ’ period, Ξ became its fixed representative.
But meanwhile, aster ei had assumed a simple sound, it
came in turn to be used in place of Ξ in words where it
was not etymologically justified3 that is, where there never
had been a real diphthong pronounced.

Nom 1. The original ei seems first to have passed into a simple
sound intermediate between ἓ and ἱ, so that both ἓ and ἱ were likely to
be substituted for it in writing. Later this half-way sound gradually
settled down into i. Accordingly ei came to be looked on as a con·
venient graphical designation for the long i·sound, and was written
indifferently for any i, very seldom for ἓ.

ΝσῙῈ 2. We thus distinguish two sorts of ei. (1.) The genuine
diphthong which was once pron‘ounced as such, so that the diphthongal
spelling is etymologically justified. This is the case for instance in
root-syllables as strengthening of i, as deico (dio), scidas (siah), like
λείπω (alm) ς and in the dative singular of the third declension‚ virtu·

tei ,· also in the nominative, dative, and ablative plural οἱ the second ·

declension, virei, doneis (where it stands for still older oi), and in the
dative and ablative plural of the first declension, vicis (where it stands
sor older ai) ς so, too, in the pronouns heic and quei, in sei ‘if ’ς and
in other words. This genuine ei is found in the earliest inscriptions,
(2.) The spurious ei, never pronounced as a diphthong, but merely
written in place of ἱ. 1t is unknown in the earlier inscriptions, but
frequent from about the Gracchan period (620l134) on. Examples
are amdan, audeire: th‘e accusative plural and ablative singular of
i·stems, as omneis, ῥητά ,· the infinitive passive, as darei: also the
