iv REMNANTS OF EARLY LATm.

And in some cases 1 have not felt bound to follow the original
documents in respect of the division of words3 thus 1 have writ-
ten plebet’ve, sublegi, quasti (n. 106 1111 ¹⁸, n. 109), not plebei ve,
sub legi, qua sei‚· as such inequalities signify nothing but the pass-
ing caprice of the writer. Where prepositions are joined to the
following noun some will perhaps wish that 1 had printed them
so. But this usage, by no means characteristic of early Latin,
but rather of the imperial period, was at no time the prevailing
one, and it did not seem worth while to perplex the reader with
forms like inca-stret& (n. 81) and abeas res (n. 104 ⁴³) . But in
general the originals have been followed even in the division of
words,

As to the selection of inscriptionS, 1 drew the line at Sulla's
dictatorship, and admitted nothing later than the law about the
quaestors, n. 106. Down to this period it was my aim to give
pretty much all the inscriptions that illustrated the old language
in any striking way, yet by rigidly excluding less profitable matter
to keep the book within narrow limits. Accordingly 1 threw out (1)
inscriptions too fragmentary to give any connected sense, (2) those
of little or no linguistic interest, (3) all un·Latin inscriptions, for
instance CI. 183 and 194, (4) the Lex Acilia repetundarum and
the Lex agraria, though sorely against my will, for reasons given
on p. 69. That 1 have made everywhere the best possible selec-
tion, 1 am by no means sure. — The arrangement of the inscrip-
tions is approximately chronological, — rather more so than in the
Corpus Inscriptionum, —but it was natural and convenient to
put like material together. And of course in a great many cases
the evidence on which monuments are assigned to this or that
period is presumptive merely. The Carmen Arvale and the
Columna rostrata are put last of all, for reasons which will be
apparent.

The book might reasonably have ended with Part 1. But it
seemed a pity to ignore those few remainS, of a legal and liturgi-
cal nature, which in their origin far antedate the earliest of our
inscriptions and the beginnings of literature, — remains which,
in spite of the modernizing process they have undergone, are
still in many ways hardly less instructive monuments than the
