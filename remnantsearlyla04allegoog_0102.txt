off: If judge or either of the litigants is ill or has a judicial appointment
‘with a foreignen the trial is to be postponed.-This fragment is put together
‘from Gell. xx. 1, ’ῆς Cic. de off. i. 12: Fest„ p. 273.

178. Fest.. pp. 233. 375. He ‘whose witness has failed to appear ma'y
summon him by loud oells in frontes his house (obvagulatio) every third (7)
day. - defuerit: future persect— tortus diebus is most naturally taken
as tertio quoque die, bnt very likely means ' every other day: after the old-
fashioned way of wanting—portum: according to Festus means ⁸ house:
perhaps rather ⁸ doorways—obvagulatum: supine. The verb points 'to
a noun *νᾶὲ-ιίῐω. The root is os course the same as in vag-iit.

179. Execution for debt. ‘One who has confessed a debt, or against
whom Judgment has been pronounced, shall hav'e thirty days to pay it i'n.
¹Aster that, forcible seizure of his person is allowed. The creditor is to bring
him before the magistrate. Unless he pays the amount of the Judgment,
or some one in the presence oi the magistrate (1n iure) interferes in his
behalf as vindex, the creditor is to take him home, and fasten him in
stocks or fetters. He is to fasten him with not less than fifteen pounds οἳ
weight, or, it he choose, with more (ἶ). It' the prisoner choose he may
furnish his own food. If he does not do this, the creditor must give him
a pound of meal daily: if he choose he may give more! Gellius, xx. 1,
45.— aeris . . . sunto: the meaning is clear, but the text is questionable:
as it is, genitive and dative stand parallel: ⁸ thirty days shall be the lawful limit
osan acknowledged debt and fhr matters that have been decided.' Schoell
brackets rebusque ium so as to construe, ‘for those who have been con-
demned in an acknowledged debt.' — endo eo (= in eo) t ⁸ over him: ⁸ in
his behalf': cp. in ea glaeba vindicarent, Gell. xx. ιο, 9.- vindioit: prob-
ably present indicative ot' a *vindiciae = vindicare .· cp. verberit, n. 166. A
vindex interfering at this stage ot* the proceedings, could stay the execu-
tion, buthe became responsible for double the amount in case the cause
on rehearing was decided against him. —nervoz Festus defines, ⁸ ferreum
