Janus and Jupiter, with these prayers. Both stmes and {erctum are
sacrificial cakes: the former is described as consisting of several long cakes
joined side by side, like the fingers of the hand. Observe the exactness of
the sacrificial language: struem commovm, but serctum &mem—quae-
soque 1 have added stom n. 153, v. a—domo in both a and b the mss,
place after liberisque meis: but see n. 156, v. ιο, and n. 153, v. 3, 15.

156. Ibid. 139. Formula for the clearing of a wood (⁰lucum conlucare
Romano more sic oportet ¹). A swine is offered as a piaculum, to appease
the forest-divinities whose domain is to be encroached οτι-81 dous. si
dea: such expressions were used at times to avoid the possible blunder of
calling on the wrong deity -a scrupulousness characteristic of Roman wor-
ship. So when an earthquake occurred (Gell. ii. 28), a propitiatory sacri-
fice was offered si deo si deae, sor sear that there might be some uncertainty
as to what particular god was thus showing his displeasure. Si . . . si ==
sive . . . sive. Cp. Plaut. Capt. 110.—- quoium (= cuium) : the possessive
adjective quoius, frequent in Plaut. and Ter. (quoia vox, quoium puerum).
—Sacrum2 ⁸ sacred domain.' - piaculo (v. 2, 8. 13) 1 suspect, metri
causa. Cato does not seem to have fully felt the rhythm of the carmina
which he reproduees.-—coercendi (v. 3) : ⁴ restraining' or ⁸ limiting ⁹ the
sacred wood, is a mild expression for cutting it down. — fecerit (v. 5)
refers of course to the felling of the treeS.
