line is gone, but the supplements are tolerably certaiu.-The tenor of the
fragment is as follows:—

(1.) Lines 1-6: Civil and political disabilities to attach to curule magis-
trates as a penalty for violating the law.

(2.) Lines 7-13: Fines imposed on lesset- magistrates and on senators
for violations os the law·

(3.) Lines 14-22: An oath of obedience to the law is prescribed for all
magistrates.

(4.) Lines 23-32: A similar oath is prescribed sor senators.

Lines 1-6. ln popuco ioudicio: this includes both the nearlyobso-
lete indicium populi before the comitia (tributa or centuriata) and public
eials before iudices (Jurymen). The offender is debarred the privilege of
sitting in the senate, and os acting as one os the iudt'ces at a trial; he must
not be asked his sentente‘a in the one, nor be given a tabella (to vote with)
at the omen—ne: see on neiquIs, n. 82, l. 3. All three forms, ni, nei, ni

cp. nontiata, n. 105, l. 5, and pronontiata, Lex repet. CI. 198, 1. 42. Both
*nbnte‘us and nr'mtius are contracted from *noventius (·new-comer').—
recuperatorem: recuperatores were a special kind of judges or jurymen,
who were appointed, instead of ordinary iudices, to decide certain classes
of suits, primarily those in which international relations were involved, as
claims sor money between Romans and peregrini: the matter is, however,
not fully understood. A iudex may be public (belonging to one of the
regularly constituted boards) or private (appointed by the magistrate for a
particular private suit). An arbiter is appointed by a magistrate to settle
involved affairs (claims and counter-claims) where there is no direct and
sharply defined issue between the parties—in puplico luuci (Introd.
