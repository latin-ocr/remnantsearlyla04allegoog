Ι) -Genuensesz object os oportere. We have here the construction oportet
me allquldfieri‚· it behooves me that something be done: but 1 do not know
a parallel case. oportatis for *op-portet, ⁸ falls to my share ⁹ (from an obso-
lete *portin),.and so its taking a direct object is not surprising.—Lines
45, 46. ad nos: the commissioners named belom—primo ‘quoque
dle: ‘at the earliest possible day.'—controversis: see on l. 35. The
following words were hopelessly confused by the graver, who could not
understand his copy. The sense requires something like contmvmis ab·
stineant (Mommsen).—— Meticanio and Peliamo are probably nomina·
tives of 0-stems with -s omitted. Observe the relation, in these Ligurian
names, between the surnames in vnio-s and the fathers' names in -ono-s.
The surnames would seem to be hardly more than patronymics formed with
suffix -i0-‚ such sor instance as the Boeotians had: Ἀποὶλοὸώριος -- son of
Ἀπυλλ όὸωρος. 1n fact. a large part of the Roman gentilicia had a like ori·
gin, Titllius from Τ ullus, Quintius from Quintus.

105. C1. 201. Bronze plate found at Tibur, now lost. The Tiburtines
had fallen under some suspicion (of what offense we do not know). and
had sent to Rome to clear themselves before the senate, upon which this-
decree was passed. This is all that can be made out. Τὴε age of the iu-
scription is uncertain: from its spelling it would seem to belong not very
far either side os 654! 100. The document3 like the S.C. de Bacchanalibus
(n. 82), is not strictly a decree, but a letter from the praetor embodying the
substance of the decree.—For the opening forms see n. 82—Lines 1, 2.
