77. CI. 34. An unknown Scipio. Judging by annos (double n), sit
(not siet) and the lack of ablative -ae, it cannot be very old; and probably
is not far from the age of n. 76.-—0n. n.= Gnaei ›repon—quom is the

in a fragment, CI. 532: and oina quom -—-· ἃηᾶ cum in the Lex agraria, CI.

‘tomb.' Ritschl conjectured Dite-ist, i.e., Ditei est, but this does not accord

, so well with the indications of the stone. Other suggestions have been

made.—ne quatratis. etc.: ‘ ask not what office he held, since none was
intrusted to him.' quairati's seems to be the scanning intended, but in spite
of this indication (which is quite isolated) it is extremely doubtful whether
the personal ending -tis was ever really long. — miuus est: Introd. 17, note.

by Livy, xlv. 44.— Pater: Scipio Asiaticus, or Asiagenus‚ defeated Anti-
ochus 564l190. —Antioeomx Introd. 15.—The date of this inscription
cannot be sar from 594l160.
