singular: cp. n. 42, and note—In 17 and 18 (coins of Luceria) we have
the names of the duomviri who superintended the mining, in the nomina-
tive singular (Introd. 17). They are to be read Lucios pallios Luci filios,
Gaios Medios Gnaivi filios: Servios Postumum, Poplios (im, Publius) Bab·
bios. For Gnaivi === Gnaei, cp. n. 74 b.

19-45 = CI. 43-52, 54, 56-6o‚ with additions from Eph. Epigr. 5-24, and
Philologus, 37, p. 175. The vessels and works of art are mostly of Etruscan
origin, and date somewhere from 350-200 B.c. The Latin language was
rapidly spreading in Etruria. The pocola were sacred temple utensils; each
bears the name of the god to which it belonged—19. Acontiu- isas it
were *Aequitia (= Aequitas), formed like iustitia, duritia, etc.: c is sor qu,
and e is the o of stem aequo· not yet sunk quite into i. Whether in a geni·
tive like this we are to read ·ᾶῐ (Introd. 27). or contracted ai (= ae), cannot
be tola—20. Belola: probably dialectic for Bellbna: the cup is orna·
mented with a head having snake-hair. — 21. A goddess Coera (ε Cura?)
is not elsewhere known.— 22. Kerus means ⁴ creator ' (root as in cre-are),
and in the Salian Hymns (n. 157) Janus was called ⁸ duonus cerus: but it is
by no means certain that Janus is meant here. - 23. Laverna (root as in
lta-crum, &nodab-etv) was a goddess who is said to have enJ‘oyed the special
veneration of thieves.-24. Saeturnus is an old form of Sciturmes, but
the ae (or air) is hard to explain. The root is certainly sa-‚ ⁴ sow! Saturu
was god of agriculture. — 25. salutes: see Introd. 37. — 27. Aisclapius
== Ἀσκλᾱπιός, without the help-vowel used in the ordinary form Aescula-
pius. The diphthong in this name receives its elucidation from the dialec-
tlc Greek form Αἶσχλαπίῳ on a bronze statuette (Ann. dell· inst. arch. 1834,
p. 223). pococolom is of course only a blunder.— 28. On a bronze bust
of Medusa. Oufentina, sc. tribu. See Introd. 10. The designation of a
man’s tribe is added in the ablative. The tribe Ufentina was formed 436l318.
