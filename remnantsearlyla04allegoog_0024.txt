8 REMNANTS oF EARLY LA‘rm.

nefhllowing are merely graphicalpeculiarities.

21.. Double consonants were written single until after
200 B.C.; eset, Marcelus ,· and for more than a hundred
years later the usage is variable3 but it must not be inserted
that they were pronounced as single consonants.

22. Doubling of vowels to indicate their length: aara.
This was a temporasy fashion, lasting srotn the time of the
Gracchi (134 B.C.) to about 75 B.C. The vowels i and o

are never doubled.

23. The use of q for c before vowel u .· pequnia,· and the
more frequent use of k.

24. The writing of xs for x, as saxsum, belongs mostly to
the Gracchan period.

2⁵. Of the use of the sign C as g (see thot-note, p. 4), there are
but scanty traces on existing coins and inscriptions, though we know
from ample testimony that in earlier times it was so employed; namely‚
in the laws of the Twelve Tables. But soon after 300 B.C. the sign
G was already in use. It is perhaps needless to say that, in the abbre-
viations C„ Cn. (for Gaius, Gnaeus), the sign C is this old g. There
were no such names as Caius, Gnaeus.
