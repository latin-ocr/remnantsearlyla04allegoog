vi REMNANTS οῖ’ EARLY LATIN.

In the Introduction, in spite of the temptation to expand it into
a treatioe on Latin grammar, Ι have only registered such leading
facts as seemed essential to an· intelligent reading of the selec·
tions. It is suggested that students learn carefully this introduc·

. tory part before proceeding to the body of the work. .

Several friends have helped me with advice here and there.
But 1 am under the greatest obligations to Professor Lane of
Harvard University. He has taken the warmest interest in the
work, and besides lending me books, has read and criticised the
proof-sheets of the whole. 1 am sure that there is not a page of
the book but is the better for some correction or addition sug·
gested by him3 and even this is saying too little. 1 am also
indebted, for aid on points of law, to Professor Gurney of Harvard
University and Mr. A. S. Wheeler of this college, both of whom
have examined parts of my proos-sheets. To all these 1 desire
to express my hearty thanks.

Thus much in explanation of the plan of the work, and of what
is—as well as what is not—in it. The making of the little
volume has not been altogether an easy task, and Ι cannot doubt
that it has many defects3 1 only hope that they are not so serious
as to impair altogether its usefulness. 1 shall be, very grateful to
any one who will point out errors or propose improvement-z
