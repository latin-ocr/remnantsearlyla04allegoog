opos: see Introd. rae-30. On a patella found at Tarquinii. A similar
one found at Caere has an almost identical inscription.— 31. One of three
similar inscriptions on patellae. Betae, i.e., Rhetus. G. S. is probably Gai
servos, i.e., Gai libertus. The slave Rhetus assumed at manumission his
master's (C. Gabinius) gentilician name. calebus for Calibus by what is
probablya mere irregularity of spelling: cp. n. 75 b.; 104, l. 39.— 32. Τ. n.

niana, found at Praeneste, with admirable engraved designS. Dindta-
elsewhere a nomen gentilicium - seems here a feminine praenomen. Ma-
colnia = Magulnia. Probably the c is meant as g. and we should pro-
nounce Magolm'a .· Introd. 25. fileai and tenid are mere inaccuracies.
Novios must be thought of as a freedman of the Plautian gens, med is
accusative: Introd. 44. Roma-1: locative.

The following, from mirrors and cistae, are designations attached to the
figures of the drawings. They are meant to be Latin, but some are tinged
with foreign—doubtless Etruscan—peculiarities. Indeed 1 have omitted
four of these, as quite too un-Latin; but 1 cite from them a few forms
- which are instructive as showing how Greek names were Italicized in early
times: Aciles (Achilleus), Casentera (Casandra), Crisida (Chrysels), Teses
(Theseus), Ateleta (Atalanta), Felena ( Helena: probably Velena, Εελὲνα,
F being used as in Etruscan), Acmemeno (Agamemnon), Lavis (Lais).
