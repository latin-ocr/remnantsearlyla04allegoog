THIS is an introductory Latin book, suitable for those who begin

at an early age and with an imperfect knowledge of English.

It opens with a short and easy review of English grammar. In
the lessons, the changes in the forms, useS, and relations of words
are explained and illustrated, so far as is practicable, from English.

Special attention is given to order and arrangement. The sim-
ple verb—formS, which are easier than nouus, and open the way to
a wide range of expression, are presented first. Sentences are given
from the start‚ with both questions and answer8‚ in natural and
easy succession.

The vocabulary and the examples to illustrate the rules of Syn-
tax are mostly drawn from the first book of Caesar.

Exercises for sight-reading are introduced early in the course.
