:1⁷1oe Saturnian Vme-

65. Saturnian is the name given by the Romans to that

,- form of verse most used by them in early times. It is an
indigenous Italic metre, and before the introduction of the

dactylic hexameter and other Greek metres, it received, at
the hands of Andronicus and Naevius, some slight degree
of literary culture.

66. Each verse consists os two tripodic series, separated
by a caesura 3 both with trochaic close (Δ. u), and the first
with anacrusis. The theses (ictus-syllables) are long, but
may be resolved into two shorts. The interior arses and the
anacrusis are either a long syllable, or a short, or two shorts 3
and the arsis before the last thesis of each series may be
suppressed. Tne scheme accordingly is:

242³..ss ssss-ssss'ss ὦκ’·

υ

For examples see n. 74-77, 98, 111, 137, etc.

67. Α secondary form has the first series catalectic, but

adds an anacrusis to the second. For an example, see n. 75
(b), v. 1.

68. Rarely nnapoh'c series occur among the Saturnians.
They are longer than the above by one syllable - an addi·
tional thesis at the end. For an instance see n. 75 (b), v. 6.
