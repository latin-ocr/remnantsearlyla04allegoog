PART First consiste of twenty-three lessons, covering the sim·

pler or more usual constructions, and is designed to be used
either as complete in itself for the uses of the preparatory school,
or as a sufficient introduction to the higher syntax, commencing
with Indirect Discourse. .

all the leading principles of syntax. The exercises in these les·
sons are, as a rule, selected from the works of classic authors, and

a serviceable guide in the elementary principles of Latin Etymol·
ogy, as well 88 Prosody.
