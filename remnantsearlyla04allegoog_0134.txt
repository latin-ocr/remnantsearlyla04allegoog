ΙΤ provides the means for studying the grammar systematically

from ‚the beginning; makes the earlier Iessons very simple, so
as to require as little labor as possible in translation, and leave a

THE book consists of two parts, viz.: one of 136 pages of selec·
tions, cut as solid blocks from the work of the masters; and
of a second part made up of short, crisp selections suited to either
oral or written work. Continuity and variety are thus both gained.
Among the authors from whose works selections have been made
are: Cicero, Caesar, Vergil, Nepos, Quintus Curtius, Eutropius,
Tacitus, Livy, Horace, Beza, Sallust, and otherS. Foot-notes and
a limited ordo give occasional aid to the student, but only when
aid is absolutely necessary. The selections are not only good in
themselves, but chosen and arranged with reference to the special
purpose of the book.
