4 REMNANTS OF EARLY LATIN.

written. Of late years there has been greatly increased
activity in collecting and studying Latin inscriptions·

4. The recently awakened interest in the study of early Latin,
which has gone hand in hand with the historical or ‘ comparative ’
study of language generally, received its first distinct impulse from
Friedrich Ritschl (b. 1806, d. 1876), who besides his well-known
labors on Plautum and numerous other contributionS, published in
1862 “Priscae Latinitatis Monumenta Epigraphicass' a collection of
the earliest inscriptions with admirable fac-simile representations. All
inscriptions of the republican period are united, with fuller commen·
tary, in the first volume of the “ Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum ’'
(Berlin, 1863), edited by Theodor Mommsen. Among the many
others who have furthered these investigatious, wilhelm Corssen
(b. 1820, d. 1875) deserves special mention for his grammatical re·
searcheS‚ embodied in the large work, “ Ausi-praebe, Vokalismus und
Betommg der lateinischen Spraclte,” 2 voIS. (2d edit„ Leipzig, 1868-70),
andin two smaller books.

5. The Romans learned the art of writing and received the alpha·
bet from the Greeks of Cumae‚¹ at a time not to be exactly defined.
The oldest extant inscriptions date from about 300 B.C., but writing is
certainly known to have been practised‚ though probably to a limited
extent, long before that period.

1 The Cumaeans used the old west-Greek alphabet differing in several
respects from the later Attic alphabet familiar to us. The Romans adopted
it without essential change, except that they rejected the signs ἴοι· θ, Χ, Φ»
(ffl ψ Φ) as useless for their language, and altered the function of the sign
F. The first Roman alphabet, of twenty-one signS, must have been (neglectb
ing minor differences in the form of a few letters),—

ABC(==g)DEFZH1K(=c)LMNOPQRSTvx,

the sign C being used exclusively for the sound g, and K always for the
sound c. Then Kwent gradually out of use, and C was ἴοι· a time used to
designate both sounds, g and c. This being presently found inconvenient,
a new sign, G, a modification os C, was invented sor the g·sound, and re·
ceived its place in the alphabet after F, in place of Z, which had been mean·
while given up as needless. So arose the new Roman alphabet, also of
twenty-one letters, - ·
