Harold R. temer, Imtructor in
Latin, Phillips Eaeeter Academy .-
Allen δι Greenough's Latin Gram-
mar has always been the most sci-
entific Latin grammar published in
the United States. The new edi-
tion has been revised in such a
way as to retain the excellence of
its predecessore and embody the re-
sults of the latest researches. . . . The
new edition is also greatly superior
to the earlier ones in clearness ot ex-
pression and in the arrangement and
appearance of the printed page. . . .
In short, the book seems to me admir-
ably adapted for use in schools and
colleges, containing as it does all that
the college youth needS, expressed in
language which the school-bey can
understand.

John Tetlow, Head Master os Girls’
Hiylz and Latin Schools, Boston:

proved a book which was already
excellent.
