82. CI. 196. S.c. de Bacchanalibus. Bronze plate, found 1640 at
Tiriolo in Bruttii; now in Vienna. In 568s186 a secret orgiastic worship of
Bacchus had established itsels at Rome and spread to many parts of Italy.
The excesses committed at these nocturnal assemblies were so {rightfuh and
the secret organizations of the initiated became so powerful, that not only
(- public morality but the very state itself seemed endangered. For particu-
ἶ s 0 lars see Livy, xxxix. 8, fig. The senate passed a stringent decree for the
suppression of these rites. This decree was communicated to the allied
states of Italy, and the above inscription is a letter from the consuls, em-
bodying the substance of it. sent into the ‘ager Teumnus’ in Bruttii, and
there cut, according to directions (line 26), on a ⁸ tabola ahena.'— This im-
portant and instructive monument is more archaic than the foregoing inscrip-
tion (n. 81),which is three years earlier. In public documents old-fashioned
forms would naturally be adhered to. There are no doubled consonants,
κ and the ablative d appears everywhere: ai and oi are used throughout
⁸ (except aedem, l. 1). But on the other hand we have -us, -um, not -0s‚ -0m. λ]
Lines 1-4. S. = Spurius ,· cos. = consules. — Duelonai = Bellonae .·
see on duonom, n. 75.—sc(ribendo) art(uerunt): decrees of the senate
were reduced to writing after, not before, they were passed: and a commit-
tee os senators remained after adjournment to see that they were correctly
written down. These were said scribendo adesse. -arfuerunt = aafftte·
runt: the preposition has the same form as in αι’-ὀίων. Cp. arvom-um,
σφὼ-ε,- l. 24, 25.-qu01 sordet-atet esent: supply as antecedent eis.
“ Regarding the Bacchanalia it was resolved to give the following directions
to those who are in alliance with us.'—oxdeicendum = edicendum.—
Neiquis: the particle ni appears in early inscriptions in three forms, ηιξ,
nei, ni (the last retained in tri-mirum). — nabulae: sor the tense see Aneu
and Greenough's Grammar‚ 288 d, Remark; Gildersleeve's Gramma, 275. a.
