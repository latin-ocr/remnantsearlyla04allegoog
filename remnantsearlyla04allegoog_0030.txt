In the text:

Italics indicate additions by conjecture3 in the inscriptions they
supply what has been broken off or effaced: as Cornelios.

Parentheses indicate the filling out of abbreviations τ as pr(aetor).

Small final letters (as in omnem) supply, for convenience in read·
ing, consonants which have been neglected in writing because of their
weak sound ; see Introduction, 17—19. They are to be pronounced
either not at all, or very slightly.

In the notesz a prefixed asterisk signifies a hypothetical form: *de-
dant.

Dates are given thus: 520s234; that is, 520 A.U.C. = 234 B.C.
