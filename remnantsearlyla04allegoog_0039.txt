one s is written, t'or that is merely graphical, but by the now well-known
Plautinian usage which allows a long syllable to be 'used as short in certain
positions3 namely, (1) when it follows a short ictus-syllable (ὁ - = ὑ υ),
and (2) when it stands between a preceding short syllable and a following
ictus (υ - -'- =uu -'-). It is true that an interior syllable of a word is
seldom affected in this way, but cp. εἱηιὶἱὶὶὶηιαέ, Asin. 241: dictust, Pseud.
990.-n·'11t (v. 3) with long az· not infrequent in old Latin (Plautus, En-
nius). —- censbr: the original quantity, as in cambria-fult (v. 4): see
Introd. 57 (2).—‘l'aurasia and Cisauna are towns in Samnium: the for·
mer referred to by Livy, xl. 38, the latter quite unknown. Samnio Ritschl
takes as accusative, but Mommsen as ablative, saying, not without force,
that it is strange to mention two unimportant places and then say that he
took the whole country. As ablative it would mean ex Samuio partitively,
rather than in Samnio: but we miss the final d (cp. Gnaivod). — subigit:
Introd. 56. Yet we might read subigit. — Loucanam (sc. terram) for
Lucaniam—opsides: ob appears as op regularly in early Latin in com·
position before a surd consonant. Not assimilation: op is the older form:
Oscan op, Umbrian up, Greek ἐπὶ. - abdoucit: Introd. 10, note. Observe
the change ot* tense: cepit, subigit, abdoucit.

75. CI. 31, 32. Inscription a is painted, b is cut. One slab is missing,
so some οἱ the verses are incomplete: the supplements are Ritschl's (except
that οἲ v. 1). This Scipio. son of the preceding, was consul 495l259 and
fought in the first Punic war, and was censor 496l258.— afflues: a nomi·

times. But see the usual form below in b, v.4. — obsol, obser: Introd. ao.
So cosentlont below. — Hono otnom ploti-nme = hunc inum plurimi.
Introd. 48 and 8. The 2 in ploirumi is t’or ei, Introd. 9.—duon0ro=²:
dnonas and duellum are the older forms ‘of bonus, bellum. On the form of
