m‘rnonuc‘rroN. 7

ablative plural of the same, are very seldom contracted, bnt as a rule
are written -iet‘ and deis: and just so perfecte like petii appear always
as petiei, petieit, except when they are contracted‚ as obit for obiit. In
these casea ei represents the sound midway between ἓ and i, not a
pure i. Such forms as filii, filiis, petz‘i are quite foreign to the lan·
guage of this period. The compounds of {acio avoid jr' by dropping
j .· abicio ,· and stems in ·jo· and y‘ei· make, for example, genitive 653,
dative plural pompas, Biiis.

1⁵. The absence of the aspirate3‚ ch, th, ph. Τὴε older
language had for them simple c, t, p. Even in Greek werde,
χ, θ, φ are represented by the simple ‘ smooth ’ mute: Co-
rintus.

No'rE. The aspiration begins to creep in at a pretty early period
in isolated words: triumpho (n. 98, 145 B.C.), pulcher (102 B.C.)‚
lumpha (n. 116).

16. Preservation of older s for later r .· only in isolated
forms anterior to our earliest inscriptions: meliosem =
meliorem.

The fhllowingpeculiarities must be regarded as partly graphical.

1⁷. Omission of final s: Cornelio'. This occurs chiefly Ξ ς, 9 ἶ
in the very oldest inscriptions». ἑ, α] μ ’

ΝΟΤΕ. Yet final s must have had for long afterwards aweak sound‚ (ί Σ 0 Ι Ε Ι
as it is sometimes neglected in versification by all the pre-Augustan
poetS.

18. Final t is rarely left off in the very oldest monuments: dede‘.

19. Omission os final m z pocolo'·. It had always in
Latin a slight and obscure sound‚ and is frequently neglected
in writing in the older inscriptions. Later — say after 200
ΒΩ. —it is much more constantly written.

20. Omission of n before s .· chor, σῶοί. In this situa-
tion n had only a slight sound‚ but it nasalized and length·
ened the preceding vowel.
