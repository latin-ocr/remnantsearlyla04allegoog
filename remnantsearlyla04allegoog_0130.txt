HIS edition includes thirteen orations arranged chronologi·
cally, and covering the entire public life of Cicero. The intro-
ductions connect the orations, and, with them, supply a complete
historical study of this most interesting and eventful period. Τὴθ
Life of Cicero, List of his Writings, and chronological Table will
be found of great value. The orations are: Defence of Roscius,
Impeachment of Verres (The Plunder of Syracuse and Cructfin'on
of a Roman citizen), The Manilian Law, the four orations against
Catiline, For Archias, For Sestius, For Milo, The Pardon of Mar-
cellus, For Ligarius, and the Fourteenth Philippic.

The notes have been thoroughly rewritten in the light of the
most recent investigatione and the best experience of the class-
room. Topics of special importance, as, for instance, the Antiqui-
ties, are given full treatment in brief essays or excursuses, printed
in small type. References are given to the grammars of Allen δι
Greenough, Gildersleeve, and Harkness.
