Iunoni, and Victor? (n. 88). Pales was a goddess os herdsmen. sacra In
both inscriptions refers to the altar (am) on which each stands. The Tus-
culan worship was transplanted to Capua by colonists. See on n. 107.

92. CI. 807. On different sides of an altar at Bovillae, near Alba. the
cradle of the Julian gens, where the family rites were kept up even in im·
perial times—Vediovei: Vediovis or Veiovi: was an Italic divinity of
some importance‚ represented as Apollo-like, with arrows in his hand:
but not much is known about hiim—genten& Iuliei: i.e.‚ members of
the Julian gens. The spelling genteiles (cp. enidius, n. 74, 75, ete.) proves
that the inscription cannot be older than the time os the Gracchi: the ei is
quite unjustified etymologically: see Introd. 9, note 2—aara, leoco:

plural, of a form otherwise unknown. It would seem to be a contraction
directly from the original -ᾶ-ἱε. The ἓ in divas stands sor ei, cp. n. 57:

0. R. is explained civis Romana, but Mommsen conjectures C. fi -—- Gai

means, of course, the eldest daughter.
