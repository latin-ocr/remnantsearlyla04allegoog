-quesz nom. plum so eois, just below. Introd. 47, 51.— necesus (not
elsewhere found) is clearly used here as neuter, but seems to have been
originally a nominative masculine, which having lost its other cases, was
no longer felt as such: necessum (Plaut.) is the neuter to it.

Lines 5-9. senatorbusz only a blunder, as senatoribus stands l. 9
and 18.-Bacas=ssacclzas. These rites belonged properly to women
only: the admission of men to participation in them had been the chief
source of lawlessness. Liv. xxxix. 13.—-ad.iese = adiisse: and so adi-
esent= adiissent, just below, and adieset, l. 17. As to the nature of
these forms, Corssen thinks them actual dissimilations to avoid the succes·
sion i-i. But those who think the pluperfect subjunctive and perfect infini-
tive compounded with essem and esse respectively (as the pluperfect indica-
tive is with eram .· see Allen and Greenough,118‚foot·note) will find in them
rather the retention of an older sound: cp. Introd. 124.—n0m1nus: Introd.
37.-1.·at1n1 ( cp. urbam, l. 21): the genitive singular has simple -Ξ, whereas
the nominative plural (vitei. oinuorsei, l. 19, 20) has -εἰ, This is the
usage of the older monuments: cp. n. 24, 26, 27, ete.. and Barbati, n. 75.
Not until later does -ei in genitive appear: see n. 99, 1. 4. The nomen
Latinum comprised at this time those cities of Latium which enjoyed a
sort of half citizenship, and were so intermediate between cives and socii.—
socium: gen. plur.: Introd. 35.—senatuos: Introd‚ 41.—10usiset2
‘shall have given leave.'— censuere: ⁸ Carried:

Lines 10-14. nequis vir: that is, women only can hold this priest-
heom—magister: an officer (not a priest) to manage the temporal affairs
of the organization. So magistratum below: ‘no one shall appoint either
man or woman to be master nor to act as master! The guilds are to be
entirely broken up: hence the prohibition to have pecunia comninis. —
oomomem == communem .· Introd. 8.-qutquam ι- quisquam— post
