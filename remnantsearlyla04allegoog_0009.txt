PREFACE.

...0—

IN undertaking this little book 1 proposed to myself to get

together in small compasS‚ and in a convenient shape for read-
ing and reference, such of the remains of the earliest Latin - pri-
marily inscriptions—as are most important as monuments of
the language, with enough explanation to make them fairly intel-
ligible. The need of such a collection had been felt, 1 found, by
others as well as myself, and this need had been only partly met
by Wordsworth's ‘⁶ Fragments and Specimens of Early Latin '’
(London‚ 1874), a work which, with all its merits‚ is cumber-
some‚ ill arranged for reference, and too expensive to be widely
circulated. The present book is designed first of all for the more
advanced of our college student3‚ but 1 venture to hope that
maturer scholars may find it useful as a convenient handbook‚
since it comprises within a few pages matter somewhat scattered
and not very generally accessible.

The book is in no wise meant to teach palaeography. The in-
scriptions are presented simply as specimens of Latin. The text
of each is given in minusculeS, without any attempt at representing
the appearance or arrangement of the stone or bronze. To have
done this last, even roughly‚ would have greatly increased the
bulk and expense of the volume (especially as most of the in-
scriptions would necessarily have been repeated in minuscules
after all, for cursory reading) without rendering it any better for
its main purpose. 1 desired furthermore to avoid everything
which would needlessly confuse the eye or the mind of the reader.

Thus it seemed best to indicate to the eye omitted final s and m.
