of half-fed slaves of large land-holders. This brigandage Popilius tried to
reptem—Italicorum: see n. 86.—de agro puplico: the reference is
to the enforcement of the agrarian law of the previous year (6211133), by
compelling those who occupied too much public land for grazing purposoe
(penatores) to give up a part of it to tillers (aratoribus).—1omm:
here a mere place of business, constructed by the builder of the road for
the aid of traffic, like the forum Appi on the Via Appia.

On one side is a part of a law in the Oscan language referring to local affairs
of Bantia: on the other side the above portion of a law in Latin. What the
relation of the latter to the Oscan law is. or whether it has any thing at all to
do with it, cannot be with certainty made out. The part of the Latin law pre·
served is from near the end, and treats only of the so—called sanctiens : what
the purport of the law was we do not know. But as the magistrates mentioned
are clearly the ‘Roman magistrates. we have evidently a Roman, not a
Bantine, document. Mommsen thinks the enactment to have been of the
nature of a fhedus, a law making or changing a treaty with Bantia. The
only thing that can be made out concerning the body of the law is that it
provided for the annual election of a iudex of some kind. The date is cer»-
tainly between 6211133 and 636l118= see on ιγ. The beginning of each
