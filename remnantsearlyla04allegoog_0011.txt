PREFACE. V

inscriptions themselves. In Part ΙΙ., therefore, the most note-
worthy of this material has been collected. Here of course only the
outward form and the diction, with now and then a grammatioel
detail, can lay claim to antiquity. In these selections 1 have
followed the best editionS‚ noting carefully the few changes 1
have allowed myself. To have attempted at all to restore the
ancient grammatica] forms would have been profitleSS, but 1
have silently corrected vu and uu, writing divom, mortuom, and
the like, even against the tradition. Occasion has been here
taken to illustrate somewhat fully the nature of the oldest Roman
poetry, according to the principles first laid down by Westphal.
lt is hoped that this feature, which is quite new, may not be un·
welcome. — All literary matter, it will be observed, has been
excluded. It was no part of my plan to edit the fragments of
Naevius, EnniuS, and other early poets. If even the most read·
able of these had been added, the book would have become
much larger, without, as it seemed to me, a corresponding in·
crease in usefulnesS. Possibly at some time hereafter it may
seem best to embody some of these fragments in a separate vol·
ume similar to this.

The commentary touches mainly on matters of language. It
was not my intention to make the selections the vehicle of syste-
matic instruction in Roman antiquities or law3 only such points
as came up 1 have tried to explain enough to make a fair under·
standing of the text possible. Especially in matters of law the
interpretations had to be strictly exoteric3 they are not such as
a jurist would need, but 1 hope that for untechnioel statements
they are fairly accurate. Being myself an ἰδιώτης in this depart-
ment, 1 could not have attempted more, had it been desirable.

The foundation of the notes in the inscriptional part is, as a
matter of course, Mommsen's commentary in the Corpus Inscrip-
tionum. And a good deal of aid, first and last, has been derived,
in both parts, from Wordsworth's book mentioned above,— in

the main a thorough and painstaking work, despite ocoesional '

lapseS. These special sources must be acknowledged. But
there was plenty of opportunity to supply new remarks and illus·
trationS. ln grammar, Corssen's works have been laid most
frequently under contribution.
