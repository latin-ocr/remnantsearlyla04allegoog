69. The Saturnian seems to be a development of a still older
and ruder Italic verse-form, in which the most ancient carmina were
conceived. Carmen means ‘ formula,’ ‘set form of words ’ς such in
the earliest times were always in some sort of verse, however rude.
This rhythmical character, before the art of writing was known, was
all that gave such formulae any permanence, and preserved them from
constant change. Accordingly we find that not only the prayers and
proverbs, but the laws— or rather legal maxims— of this period, and
the set forms of speech of political and religious life, are constantly
spoken of as carmina. Of the outward form of this earliest poetry we
can form some idea from such specimens as ιι. 153 flg. 1t is based
word-accen! rather than on quantity, and is in this respect like English
verse. The theses (ictus-syllables) are not necessarily long, but the
accented syllable of every word, whether long or short, must stand as
thesis. For the rest the general rhythm is not unlike the Saturnian, but
the verse is more freely constructed, and syncopation (omission of the
arsis) is much more frequent, The rhythmical divisions correspond in
. general with divisions of the sense. Each half-verse has four, rather
than three, ictus; but when, as is usual, the two last are brought to·
gether by syncopation, the last does not receive much stress. See fur·
