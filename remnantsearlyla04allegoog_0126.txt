THE aim of this book is to serve as a preparation for reading,

writing, and (to a less degree) for speaking Latin, and to
effect this object by grounding the learner thoroughly in the
elements through abundant and varied exercises on the forms
and more important constructions of the language.

The idea determining and controlling the plan is the maximum
of practice with the minimum of theory, on the principle that the
thorough acquisition of the elements of Latin by the young learner
must be more art than science, — more the work of observation,
comparison, and imitation, than the mechanical following of rules,
or the exercise of analysis and conscious inductive reasoning.

An effort has been made, while following a rigorously scientific
method in the development of the successive subjects, to impart
something of attractiveness, interest, freshneSS, and variety to the
study of the elemeuts of Latin. Means to this end are the colloquia
(simple Latin Dialogues), the choice of extracts for translation,
introduced as early as possible, and the mode of treatment in every
part, extending even to the choice of Latin words and to the con-
struction of the exercises.

This book can be completed and reviewed by the average learner
in a year, and may be followed by any Latin Reader, by Viri
Romae, or by Nepos or Caesar.

It supplies, by means of the Colloquia and Glossarium Gram-
maticum, precisely the kind of help that teachers need who desire
to make some practical use of Latin in oral teaching.

Over two-thirds of the words used belong to the vocabulary of
Caesar’s' Gallie War ,· little less than two-thirds to the vocabulary

of Nepos.

Ἴ ⁸'I'he book is pronounced a well-nigh perfect combination of
seholarship and teachableneSS. Only a very few testimonials are
presented here.
