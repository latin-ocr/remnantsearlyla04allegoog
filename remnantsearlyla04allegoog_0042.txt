Law of Luceria about a sacred Grave.

proiecitad‚ neve parentatid. Sei quis arvorsum hac faxit, in
ium quis volet pro ioudicatod n(umum) Ι manum iniectio

⁹19. CI. 38. Son of the first Scipio Hispallus, or Hispanus as it is here
called, who was first cousin to Africanus maior. His praetorship was in
615l139.—11: probably iterum, ¹ wicel—xvir, etc.: the decemviri slite’-
bus iudicandis, called earlier iudices decemviri, were magistrates whose exact
functions are little understood, but they had to act as judges in certain
cases. Slis and stlis are older forms ot' lis. The decemviri (later quin-
decimviri) sacris faciundis had the care οἱ the Sibylline books. -- The

n. 74, v. 6. -sibel must be scanned sibi. It is merely the retention of the
former spelling after the later pronunciation had set in. Cp. tibei, n. 99,
v. 1.—-h0nor: but honos in n. 76 and 77. The meaning is: ‘the offices 1
held increased the family renown.’

80. Eph. Epigr. 2, 198. Found at Luceria in Apulia. The Latin is pro·
vincial.-hooe: see on haice, n. 82, l. 22.-loucarld: ablative ot' lie'car,
which has here the meaning of licus. —stlrous = stemus.—rundat1d is
for fiandato(d) (Introd. 62), imperative offhndcire, which is oddly enough
used in the sense of fiandzm. The imperative ending -tbd appears in this
