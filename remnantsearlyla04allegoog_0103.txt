180. Gell. xx. 1, 49.‘ Tertiis nundinis: the prisoner was to be confined
sixty days, and on the last three market-days he had to be brought before
the magistrate to give an opportunity t'or any one to redeem him. At the
end of that time his person was forfeited to the creditor or creditors, who
might kill him and divide his body among them. The ancients agree in ex-
plaining partis secante in this way (partis is of course accusative),
though they add that no actual case of the kind was ever known. In point of
t'act this right was waived, and the debtor sold into slavery. (Some mod·
ern scholars understand secanto of a division of goods.) -plus minusve:
than each one's share. —se fraude: see on n. 151.
