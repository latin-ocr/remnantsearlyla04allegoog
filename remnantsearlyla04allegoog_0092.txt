159. The formula given by Livy (viii. 9) as used by the elder Decius in
devoting‘ himself to death at the battle of Vesuvius, 414l340. He repeats the
words after the pontifex, then mounts his horse and charges into the midst of
the foe, where he finds his death. The formula is no special one composed
sor the occasion, but a traditional one handed down from antiquity. For,
from the details which Livy gives, it is clear that there was an elaborate
ceremonial, with provisions l'or this and that occurrence; which is proos,
as Preller (Rom. Myth„ p. 468) remarks, that “in the Italy οἱ earlier times
such devotioris, in the bloody struggles among so many contentious nations,
were nothing uncommon.” Τὴε idea of the devotio is that the commander-
or other warrior, by voluntarily sacrificing himself to the gods of the lower
world, averts their fury from his own countrymen and turns it against the
enemy’s hosts. Α supernatural panic was believed to seize on the foe. The
above formula is certainly a carmen, and the indications of rhythm and
alliteration show that metrically it stood on a line with the prayer-s in Cato
(n. 153, flg.). The following reconstruction 1 give merely exempli causa :—

Iane, Iuppiter, Mars pater, Quirine,
Duellona, Lares,

divi Novensides‚ divi Indigetes,

di quorum est potestas nostrorum hostiumque,
divique Manes, vos precor, veneror,
veniamque peto, uti populo Romano
vim victoriam ’ prosperetis,
perduelles hostesque populi Romani
terrore formidine morteque adrexitiz.
Sicuti verbis nunc nuncupavi,

ita pro re publica populi Romani
legionibus auxiliis populi Romani,
legiones auxilia hostiurn mecum
divis Manibus, Telluri devoveo.
