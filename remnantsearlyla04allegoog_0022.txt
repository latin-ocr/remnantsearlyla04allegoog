6 REMNANTS OF EARLY LA‘rm.

genitive singular of the second declension, as populei,· ¹ and the perfect
indicative, ficei, posedeit. In tibei¹ sibei, ibet} ubei, trabeis, vobeis, ulei,
the diphthongal spelling reaches further back, and may be well founded,
though it is difficult to account for it etymologically.

10. Diphthong ou, in place of later ἃ .· dauco, Loucina.

Nom. This diphthong is almost always a strengthening of u in root·
syllables; douco (dae) as φεὺγω (φῦγ-). The very oldest Latin would
appear to have had in some cases eu for this: see n. 157 a. Very
rarely ou appears as a mere graphical sign for ἃ.

n. The earliest Latin is thus seen to have had a complete system

of six diphthongs‚ whose relations to the later vowel-system may be
thus exhibited: —

14. The studious avoidance of the successions uu and vu, by re·
taining older uo, vo (or by using c for qu), as servos, sequontur (or
secuntur), etc„ is not peculiar to early Latin, but was the almost
unvarying usage until after the Augustan epoch. But the early Latin
avoided iz· and ji no less carefully. The genitive singular of stems in
·i0- is invariably contracted, consili. The nominative, dative, and

diphthong here, namely oi, yet the oldest monuments have uniformly i:
