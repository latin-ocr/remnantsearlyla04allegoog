hund on the site os the grove and temple οἱ the Dea Dia, five miles from
Rome on the Via Campana3 the present tablet in 1778. The prayer was
sungbytbebeotberhoodintheopenair,accompanied bya solemn duee
(mpodatio). 1t is in itself by far the most venerable spec‘unen of Lffin
which we possess, but as our copy dates from 218 ΑΒ.. and as the cannen,
handed down from an unknown antiquity by oral tradition, had doubtless be-
come unintelligible to those who used it, it is impossible to say what altera-
tions it had undet-gone. and we cannot by any means— interesting as it is
—look on it as an uncorrupted monument of the early language. “Om-
nin0‚” says Mommsen, ‘⁸ carmen hoe ex ipsis collegii libellis a quadratariox
exceptum non multo meliore condicione accepimus quam quae huius gene-
ris apud auctores leguntur.” Hence 1 have resen-ved it for this place.—
nach verse, except the last. is thrice repeated on the stone, with a few minor
ναήαῐίοιιε, of which sen (for sins) onee, plear-is (for ploooes) twice, and
fiam (sor βίον) once. may be mentioned. The mette is a rude Satur-
nian, with two isolated half-verses (cp. n. 98).

to the Arvales, for the brotberbood traeed its origin to Acca Larentia and 2<
her sona-iuvate: Ritschl notes that *iuvate was probably the original
form. See on flavius, n. 104. l. 7.— V. 2. neve: the metre requires rather
