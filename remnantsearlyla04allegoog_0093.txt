For demanding restitutiva.

160. (a.) Audi Iuppiter, audite fines
’ populi Albani, audiat F as,
Sum publicus nuntius populi Romani3
iuste pieque legatus venio,
5 verbisque meis fides siet.

Iane: invoked, as commonly, first of a series οἱ deities— Iuppiter,
Mare, Quirine ς the three gods who had flamines maions.— <uvi Noven-
siles: usually explained as the 'newly settled ' or ¹ foreign ' gods, in oppo-
sition to the Indigetes (indu- and root go) or ‘home-born: ‘national’
gods. ln inscriptions we have nove(n)sides (n. 57). and, according to

—1 have ventured to divide the fetial carmina into such primitive verses as
we must suppose them to have originally consisted of (see Introd. 69), and

them, they had undergone many modificationS.

The form for demanding restitution (rerum repetundarum, also called
clarigatio) is from Liv. i. 32: in v. 3 the received text reads ego sum, in v. 5
