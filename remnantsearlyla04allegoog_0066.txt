50 REMNANTS OF EARLY LATIN. [N.1o6.

aerarium provinciam optinebit eam pequniam ei scribae
scribeisque heredive eius solvito, idque ei sine fraude sua

are of course merely inserted by way os example. In the comitia tributa,
the tribe which voted first (or, according to Mommsen, that which first an-
nounced the result os its vote) was called principium. The present enact-
ment, although passed in the comitia tributa, is still a lex, because passed
at the rogation of a curule magistrate (dictator). Π proposed by a tribune,
it would be a plebis scitum, and the pmescrz'puo would have plebem, plebes,
instead of populum, populus.

The law is one of Sulla⁰s enactments during his dictatorship (Tac. Ann..

’ xi. 22) and so falls in all probability in the year 673l81. It raised the num-

ber of quaestors to twenty. The part preserved treats only os the attend-
ants (apparitores) of the city-quaestors, and provides (1) sor the payment
os the scribae, and (2) for the appointment of additional viatores and pmc-
cones .· the quaestors namely are hereafter to appoint four viatores and four
praecones, where before they appointed three, and for the next three years
the present consuls are to appoint additional viatores and praecones,— one
each for each year. But this matter is involved in some obscurity, and there
are two possible ways of understanding the arrangement. Τὴε viatores who
serve for any one year form a so-called decuria, and so too the praecones.
Now the simplest supposition is that these decuriae had heretosore con·
sisted of three men each,and were appointed by the quaestors once in three
years only, nine men being appointed, three for each of the succeeding
years: thus the quaestors for 673 would have appointed three viatores for
674, three for 675, and three for 676. The quaestors for 676 would then by
this law appoint four sor each of the following three years. But meanwhile,
that the decuriae may be immediately increased, the consuls are directed to
appoint one supplementary viator each for 674, 675, 676. But Mommsen
thinks, with some reason, that the arrangement was probably a little more
complicated. The decuriae, according to his view, had consisted of nine
men, and are hereafter to consist of twelve. One third of the decuriae for
the three succeeding years are appointed by the quaestors of each year:
namely, three (hereafter four) men in each decuria: so that the decuria
· for any one year contains appointees of the three preceding years. Thus
the viatores during the transitional period would be as follows τ -
