inscription in three forms, (1) -tbd in estb'd, licitb'd, (2) -tad in pmiecite‘id,

(3) -tzd in fimdatld, parentatid, i.e., apparently in the hrst conjugation. The

last two forms are otherwise unheard of.-—proiecst.ad = pmicito. The

compounds of iacio had in old Latin sometimes -iecio, in place os the

classical -ici0. So conieciant, CI. 198, l. 50 (Lex repet.).—— parent-‚atra =

parentato. Pamntatio would defile the grove, because it had to do with the

dead.—arvorsum=advorsum.—hao: perhaps neut. plur.: see on post

hac, n. 82, l. 13. Or possibly ablative sing. feminine: see on arvorsum ead,

n. 82, l. 25.— faxit: Introd. 59.—1um = eum—quis = quisquis, an

ancient use. Cp. n. 175 and 208. The antecedent ei is understood. ‘Let

any one who chooses lay hands on him, as for a judgment rendered of . . .

sesterces.'—manum Iniectae: the right of seizing the person to compel

payment of money due: cp. n. 179. For manum (contracted from manuam,

gen. plur.) cp. passum, Plaut. Men. 178.—pr0 ioudicatod: i.e., as is a

claim had been adjudged by a magistrate. —numum 1: Mommsen con·

the Roman general· some service against their masters. -leibereit the

oldest form had oi (loebesum = liberum in Festus); letber is frequent.—

1ousit =iussit. The spelling with single s (even insit) is very persistent

in this perfect.—dum: ‘as long as.'—pop1us: from this shorter form

(also Plautinian) come poplicus, Popli-cola, Poplius (Publius). -Observe

thatin pofilus senatusque the usual order of the words is reversed.
