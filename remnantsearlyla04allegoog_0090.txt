157. The Salii were a religious sodalitas (for this term see on n. 149)
who were concerned with the worship of Mars. On various festival-days m
the month of March they performed solemn processions and dances, bearing
the twelve sacred ancilia. The famous ancient songs which they chanted on
these occasions were called axamenta. This name is from axare, '’repeat
(found in Festus), a frequentative from &io = *ag-io (root αξη · say,' as in
adq-ium), as taxare from tango (root tog-2 Axare presupposes a parti-
ciple *axun as indeed all· frequentatives' and · intensives ' are secondary
verbs derived from participles, These Salian hymns were, according to
Quintilian (i. 6, 40), hardly understood by the priests who sang them. They
were addressed not to Mars only, but to other gods as well, and different
portions were accordingly called versus lanai, Iovii, Iunonii, etc. Only two
or three connected bits of these hymns have reached us, in an exceedingly
corrupt state. Various scholars have tried to restore them, Bergk and
Corssen with the most success, but their interpretations differ greatly. 1
have given above all that seems to have the smallest probability critically.

Fragment a is the most certain. Bergk reconstructed it from cume
ponas Leucesiae praetexere monti quotibet cunei de his cum tanatem (Teren-
tius Scauru5‚ p. 2261, P.); but Festus gives prae tet tremonti. The lines
read as Saturnians of a rather rude sort (cp. the carmen Arvale, n. 149), and
there can be no doubt that such was the metrical form of all the hymns.-
cume = cum ‚· expressly attested by Scaurus: Festus has also tame = tam.
-Leucesie = Lindie, ⁶ light-god,’ a surname of Jupiter. The s has arisen
from the t by a sostening not uncommon in Latin: the diphthong eu, on the
other hand, is an antiquity: Introd. ιο, note: cp. λευκός. —tet for ted (In-
trod. 44). Perhaps an older form, though the t may have come merely from
assimilation to the following—tremonti -—- tremunt,- the only instance of
this full ending of the 3d person plural: cp. Doric λέγοντι πλέγουσι, ..-
cuneit ‘bolts' of lightning.-dextumum: adverbial, ‘on the right'3 a
superlative formation, whereas dexteris comparative. The right, in Roman
