Genua and the Langenses Viturii, a castellum (see on servei, n. 81) or trib-
utary community of theirs. The Roman senate had sent the two brothers
Minucius to settle the dispute, who after their return to Rome rendered the
above decision.—The Viturii hold two kinds of land: (1) ager privatus ρ’
held in their own right: for this no tax is to be paid; and (2) a portion of
public lands, ager poplicus, belonging to Genua: for the use os this a gross
sum is to be paid yearly, which is to be assessed upon all the holders pm
portione, including any Genuates who may hold there (1. 25-32). Common
pasture-lands (ager compascuos, l. 33)— presumably those within the limits
of the above tract of public land— are to be open to any Genuan or Vitu-
rian. The meadows ( prata, l. 37-42) which form part of this public land,
are reserved for the sole use of the Viturii, but their extent is not to be in·
creased.—The spelling of the document is rather inconsistent. Prepesi-
tions are frequently written as proclitics; thus inre, l. 2: admittunt, 1. 13:
but this has not been followed in the text. The names of streams and moun·
tains are Ligurian. ,

Lines 1-5. Minucieis and Ruteie are nominative plural: Introd. 34.
‘Quintus and Marcus Minucius Rufus, sons of Quintus,'—Genuateie==
Genuatis: ei simply a sign for Ξ. Gentile names in -ᾶε, -itis (Arpinis, etc.)

tive plural in -is.-1n re praesente: technicalphrase; ⁸ on the spot’; cp.
