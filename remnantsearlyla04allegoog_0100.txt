174. The Twelve Tables, the first regular code of written law which the

Romans had, date from 3o3l451 (the decemviri; the 'last two ‘tables were . 'fl ἡ
added the following year), and were based upon the older unwritten and.

imperfeetly formulated laws of custom, introducing, however, some inno-
vations. The laws were written on twelve tablets of bronze, but it is
doubtful whether these originals survived the oepture of the city by the ·
Gauls, 364s390. The scanty existing fragments have been much mod-.
united: their distribution among the different tables is far from certain.
The standard critical edition is R. Schoell’s, 1866, which 1 have followed in
the main, giving of course only such fragments as contain connected words ἡ
of the Tables themselves Ι

Preliminaries to the trial. The first step is the summoning of the adver· ⁴
sary to go before the magistrate (in ius vocare).—vocat‚ tto: note the
absence of pronouns, as usual in these laws‚ often verging on obscurity. In
some places explanatory words and clauses, out of keeping with this brevity
of diction, have been interpolated: see below, and n. 176, 179. The im-
peratives in these laws are always of the third person.—antestam.inoz v
lntrod. ¹53: 'let him call the bystanders to witness· that force is neces-
sary. How this was performed the student will remember from Hor. Sat.
i. ς, fffilwlgltur: ‘them—em: ‘him.' Introd. 47.—si calvitur . . .
amit: *if he shirks or runs away' (?). What pedem struem was, the
ancianis themselves did not know, but on tne whole thought it to mean ⁸ run
away: [san il be ‘brace the feet: like one resisting a pull ?—endo tacito
= irrisisti. but not yet fused into a compound. A greater degree of force
seems to be implied than in capita—Si morbus, etc.: if the defendant is
ill nr decrepit, the plaintiff must provide a vehicle, but this need not be a
covered carriage unless he chooses.— aevstae = aetas.— vitium: ⁶ hin-
dran ne: — flacit = est: for *es-scit, an inceptive present-formation, not
yet. as in Lucretius, with a distinct future meaning. After escit Schoell has
removed the interpolation qui in ius vocabit. —iumentunn ‘team,’ im-
plies here. as often in our parlance, some sort of vehicle. —arceranr a
covered carriage, with a pallet for lying down. —no sternito: 'he need
not spread unless he chooses. —The three parts of this fragment are in*
