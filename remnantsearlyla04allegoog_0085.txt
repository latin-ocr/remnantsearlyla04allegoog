CI. 198. Date 631l123 or 632s122. 1 have omitted this document, as
well as the Lex agraria, on account of its fragmentary condition and the
amount of explanation needful to make the remnants intelligible. It is
on eleven fragments of, a bronze plate‚ along the entire length of which
the lines ran. Accordingly we have only detached parts of sentences.
Many forms of this inscription have been already noticed by way of illus-
tration, but 1 will mention here a few other noteworthy ones.— attigat
(1. 10): attigas in Plautus. One of the few remains of the Latin aot-ist.-
attigam is to attingam as λίπω to λείπω, 01· λάβω to λαμβάνω. Other
aoristic forms are adulat, evZnat, parentes (οἱ τεκόντες), —detblerit (l. 21,
76) ==detiileria — oppedeis (l. 31) = oppidis.—adessint (1. 63) = adsint
or adficerint: a formation like faxint .· Introd. 59. — sed fraude (trude)
sua (l. 64, 69) = sine fraude sua .· see on n. 106. 1. 4—possltur (ubei de
plano recte legi possit‘ur⁹ 1. 66: the praetor is to post something ⁸ where
it can be properly read from the ground ’)‚ passive: so potestur, queatur
(Lucu), quitur (Caecil.)‚ poteratur, etc.. are known. Always with the pass-
ive infinitive.— 0101, dat. sing.. occurs seven timoe.
