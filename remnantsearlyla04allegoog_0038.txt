Suppl. iii. p. ις Cales. apolone: cp. n. 65.— 73. PLM. Suppl. ii. p. 12.
The meaning is uncertain. caetud facitud seems best taken, with Ritschl,
as ablative absolute, facicm! being perhaps dialectic forfactod. Castus is a
season of fasting. Diovis is the older form of Iovis .· see n. 42and 96: Diove
also occurs in a fragment, C1. 188. Compare Ζεὺς, for ⁴¹ Διεὺς. It does not
appear whether Diovis belongs with the fiollowing or preceding words.
Iunone Louctnat is, ot' course, dative.

74. CI. 29, 30. This and the following epitaphs were found in the fam-
ily tomb of the Scipios, near the Appian Way, outside the ancient Porta
Capena, where excavations were made in the 17th and 18th centuries. They
are preserved in the vatican Museum.—1nscription a is painted only, on
the upper margin osa sarcophagus: b is cut on the side οἱ the same. The
latter is in its forms (nom. in -us) less archaic than the former, or even than
the next epitaph — that ot' the son. Hence it is all but certain that only the
painted inscription dates from the time ot* the burial, and that the other was
cut a good many years (at least 50) later. The subjectos the epitaph, the
great-grandfather ot Scipio Africanus the elder, was consul 456lae8, and cen·
sor 464l290. The campaign mentioned took place during his consulship,
in the third Samnite war.

For the Saturnian metre of this and the three following epitaphii, see
Introd. 65 flg. — Lucius: the praenomen is put after the nomen, tor
metrical convenience. Lucius apparently, with long i,· so also in the next
epitaph. This would seem to have been the earlier pronunciation. Ob-
serve that we do not have *Lamina though we might expect it, as the root
is the same as in Ζοιιιίιια, Loucetius (namely, luc-, ⁸ shine ⁸), and the Osoen
has Lanka. - Gnaivod == Gnaeo. The name Gnaivos— later Gnaeus -
is the same as (g)naevos,·m01e,' ‘birth-mark’· from it comes Naevius. -
