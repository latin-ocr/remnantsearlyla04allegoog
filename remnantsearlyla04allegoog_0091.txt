augural science, was the unlucky side. — tonaront: the perfect tonum· is
not elsewhere found.

Fragment b: Vari-o, Li'ng. L‘an vii. 27 (where supplt'cante).— cante
is canite. but what empta means no one knows: Bergk conjectures templa.
—divom deo: Janus is meant.

Fragment ο is in Varro. L. 1... vii. 26, where the following stands:
coseulodotzeso omnia vero adpatula coemisse iaincusianes duo misceruses dun
{anusve vet pos melios eumrecum. 1 give the least desperate part of this,
'nearly with Corssen (following also a suggestion of Wordsworth's).—ad-
batula= patula—coemi& = coemffre in the sense of conceperunt (emo
'meant originally ⁸ take '); with Ξ (as in emt, emisti, etc‚) and s for later ἓ and r.
—ousianos = c‘uh‘ones, officers of the Salii. There was a curia or assem-
bly-hall of the brotherhood on the Palatine.— cerus: see on n. 22.—The
whole would mean: ‘the curlones of Janus have in truth perceived clear
omens: thou art the good creator, good Janus.' But all this is extremely
uncertain, 'and so is the metrical grouping which 1 have given, merely as a
rough 'indication of the way in which the verses may have run.

We know from Festus and Varro a good many single words from the
Salian hymns‚ of which 1 select the following: foedesum =fhederum5
plustma = plurlma: menoeem = melio're‘m ,· asenam = arenam ,· pi-
lumnoe po'ploe = ¹ the spear-arrned host’ (gen. sing. ? pilumno-s, for
*pilbineno-s, is a participle like ὅηλοὺμενο-ς, and points to an old verb
*pilo-zm = pilo armare. Another remnant of the Latin o-conjugation is
aegrbms, from ἳαῳυ-ἔη, · make ill ⁰) ς promenervat = pm'monet, from
au adjective menerva-s, ⁸ thoughtful,' whence Menova, cp. n. 363 sonivio
== sonanti: cerus manue = mator bonus: privtcloee (i.e., priviculzzr)
= singulas, with an interesting ancient form of the dative plural.

158. Varro, Ling. Lat. vi. 27. Formulae used by the Pontifex minor in
announcing to the assembled people (comitia calata), at the appearance of
each new moon (kalendae), whether the nones on that month would fall on
the fifth or seventh day. Iun'o covello is the ‘hollow ' or crescent moon:
Covella is a diminutive of ’cova = cava. ‘1 proclaim thee for five days:
seems to mean that the hollow or ‘new’ moon will last during that time:
that is. up to the ⁸ first quarter’ or nones. Τὴε verses are Saturnians, but
in 0810 we have a short thesis. Besides the old verb calda, there must have
been a calm (or calin), whence calendae.
