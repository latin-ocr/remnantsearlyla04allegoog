⁵4. Final ·1t preserved long in

present indicative of i-conJugation (formed by contrac-
tion): scit (Plaut.).

present subjunctive: sit, velit (Plaut.).

future indicative: erit, venibit (Haut).

perfect indicative: see below, 57.

55. Long ῑ in forms of perfect subjunctive and future
perfect indicative ε fueris, intulerit, venerimus, dedet-inb.

⁵6. Infrequent and hard to explain is ·it in the present indicative
of the third conjugation, as ponit (Enn.).

⁵7. The perfect indicative is peculiar 3 the following points
should be noted: (1.) Perfects in -27 are invariably written
with ·iei- in the inscriptionS, so far back as our knowledge
goes: petiei, inten‘etktt} redieit. For the reason, see above,
14. (2.) The third person singular of other perfects ends
in the oldest inscriptions in -'c't and -it indifferently 3 from the
Gracchan period on in -eit and -it. Its almost uniforrn
length (more stubborn than that of other final syllables in -t)
is attested by the pects, (3.) The third person plural has
throughout the forms with and without -nt side by side : see
note on n. 68.

⁵8. Imperfect in -Ibam for debant : scibam. The future in -bo
has a more extended use than in later Latin: paribo, scibo.

⁵9. Shorter future perfect in ·so and perfect subjunctive
in ·sim τ faxo, capsim, occisit: servassit, habessit.

60. Present subjunctives duim, duis, duit, duint,
‘give ' ς edim, etc„ ‘ eat ’ 3 like sim and velim. Sim occurs
in the older forms siem, sies, siet, sient ; and *veliem‚
*duiem, *ediem‚ are likewise to be assumed.

Nom. These are old optatives: (e)s·ie·m = ἒ(σ)-ἰη-ν; *du-iem ε-
